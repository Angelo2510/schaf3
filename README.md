## 🚀 What is schaf3?

schaf3 (ASC-ODE) is a C++ library designed to help you:

-   Define and solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in a flexible way.
-   Use automatic differentiation (AD) to compute derivatives — enabling e.g. sensitivity analysis or Jacobians without manual calculus.
-   Easily switch between plain numeric types (e.g. `double`) and AD-enabled types, thanks to templated code.
-   Run demos that export data and visualize results using Python + Matplotlib (e.g. for polynomial examples or ODE trajectories).

In short: **schaf3** aims to make solving ODEs + computing derivatives easier and more expressive, without sacrificing performance or readability.
